I am using the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model for a simple chatbot. Below is a simple README file that you can use to describe the usage of my code:

Simple Chatbot with OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
This simple chatbot utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate responses based on user input. The chatbot script is written in Python and requires the OpenAI Python library.

**Prerequisites:
Python installed on your system
OpenAI Python library (openai) installed

**Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository

**Install the required Python packages.
pip install openai
Get your OpenAI API key.

If you don't have an API key, sign up for OpenAI and obtain your API key.
Replace "####" in the code with your actual API key.
Run the chatbot script.

python chatbot.py
Usage
The chatbot.py script demonstrates how to interact with the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model using the OpenAI Python library. The script sends a user message to the model and prints the generated response.

Feel free to modify the user_message variable with different user inputs to see how the chatbot responds.

Notes
Keep your API key confidential. Do not share it in public repositories or with unauthorized users.
Refer to the OpenAI documentation for more information on using the GPT-3.5-turbo model: OpenAI API Documentation
